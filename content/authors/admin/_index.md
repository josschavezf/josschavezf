I am a mexican Ph.D. Student at the Biotechnology Institute-UNAM in Merino's [Lab](https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx) focused on bioinformatics analysis of transcriptional regulators in bacteria. 

I have used [R](https://www.r-project.org) programming language during the last 4 years and since 2018 started developing my own packages. I have been awarded with scholarships from Bioconductor and RStudio to present my work as a developer at BioC Conference 2019 and 2020, and attend RStudioConf in 2020.

I am interested on expanding the community of R users and developers. Recently, I joined the board team of the [Community of Software Developers for Bioinformatics](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io) and co-founded [R-Ladies Cuernavaca](https://www.meetup.com/es/rladies-cuernavaca/).
