I am a mexican Ph.D. Candidate at the Biotechnology Institute-UNAM in Merino's [Lab](https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx) focused on the study of transcriptional regulation in bacteria from a bioinformatics approach. 

I have used [R](https://www.r-project.org) programming language during the last 4 years and since 2018 started developing my own packages. I have awarded scholarships from Bioconductor and RStudio to present my work as a developer at BioC Conference 2019 and 2020, and attend RStudioConf in 2020.

I am interested in expanding the community of R users and developers. Recently, I joined the board team of the [Community of Software Developers for Bioinformatics](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io), the board team of the [Mexican Network of Bioinformatics](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io) and co-founded [R-Ladies Cuernavaca](https://rladiesmx.netlify.app).
