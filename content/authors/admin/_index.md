I'm a recent Ph.D. Graduate focused on the study of transcriptional regulation from a bioinformatics approach. 

I have used [R](https://www.r-project.org) during the last 5 years, and since 2018 I started developing my own packages. I have awarded scholarships from Bioconductor and RStudio to present my work as a developer at BioC Conference 2019 and 2020, and to attend RStudioConf in 2020.

Besides my research project, I'm interested in expanding the community of R users and developers. I joined the board team of the [Community of Software Developers for Bioinformatics](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io), the board team of the [Mexican Network of Bioinformatics](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io) and co-founded [R-Ladies Cuernavaca](https://rladiesmx.netlify.app).
